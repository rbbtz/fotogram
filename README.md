# fotogram

Photo Gallery App built with React and Firebase. Itâ€™s similar to Instagram in its layout and functionality. React was used for the front end. And for the back end Firebase storage is used to store images and Firebase firestore, a database is used to keep track of image urls and give real time image data making refreshing the page unnecessary after adding a new image.
